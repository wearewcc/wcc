        <p>Lise Meitner was a <mark>physicist who co-discovered nuclear fission of uranium</mark> along with Otto Hahn. She was originally from Austria, and her father was among the first Jewish lawyers there. She had mostly private education in her early years as it was nearly impossible for a woman to study in public schools. She earned her doctorate in 1905 from the University of Vienna. She worked for most of her career in Berlin at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and was the first woman to be a full professor of physics in Germany.</p>

        <p>Meitner was of Jewish descent and had to flee Nazi Germany for Sweden in 1938 and became a Swedish citizen after many years. There is much controversy about her not being included in the Nobel Prize with Otto Hahn for the discovery of nuclear fission. She won many other honors over the years, including membership in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, but those were shadowed by her exclusion from the Nobel.</p>
