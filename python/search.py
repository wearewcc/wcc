# Example 1
# Simple "needle in haystack" search
# Should be found

# Example 2
# Another one, but this time the needle is not found
if 'cat' in 'How could a 5-ounce bird possibly carry a 1-pound coconut?':
    print 'Found'
else:
    print 'Not found'

# Expected: Not found


# Example 3
# Same "needle in haystack" search,
# except our needle and haystack are set defined in variables

# Example 4
# For case insensitive searching, make sure your needle and haystack are all lowercase.
